# Massachusetts Wildlife Semantic Search Engine
### By Arvind Pillai

This is currently a WIP! 

TODO:
 - Add data from MassAudobon (currently just using MassWildLife).
 - Next stage: convert to RAG pipeline to give smarter, genuine answers.
 - Add an "I'm Feeling Lucky!" feature to promote easy wildlife learning.
